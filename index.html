      <p>My name is Nolen, and I really enjoy working in the field of technology. Two years ago, I retired from IBM after 34 Â½ years. During that period of my career, I performed duties as a Project Manager, System Engineer, System Specialist, and IT Architect.  Technology that I focused on was Active Directory design and implementation; Desktop migrations and deployments; Security reviews; and account management and reviews.</p>
      <br>
      <p>During my initial two years of retirement, I did several volunteer activities. Each week for two years I worked at a food distribution center and I also resolved technical computer, mobile phone, and home network issues for friends and family. During this period, I noticed that there was still a love for technology. Funny story, when microcode on my smart television needed upgrading, I successfully completed the task, but also noticed that there was a great deal of satisfaction. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Based on these results, I decided to start a new career path as a Full stack developer. This career path will allow me hone different technical skills and open a new path of opportunity. Although I have worked in the technology for several years, I have never developed applications. But, because of skills that I have acquired, I feel that I will be able to succeed in this new adventure. I look forward to building web based applications, develop from and back end application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Node.JS.</p>
